## Vtu-Results-and-Analysis
This application is focused on benefiting the students of Visvesvaraya Technological University(Vtu). Vtu server performance has been poor
 and during the peak server load it fails to respond to the request. To access the results faster I fetch the results from Vtu server or our own server and display it without relying on their website.
 We populate our server with the results from university server as it becomes available. We analyse the results of over 200,000 students and make it available to the public. 
 Few of the statistical analysis performed are:

* Branch Topper
* Branch Average
* University Subject Topper
* University Subject Average
* Subject Pass percentage
* Ranking students of their branch
* Mean deviative

Application also automatically notifies the user when their result is available. 

Class results are provided too in the order of rank.

Few more parameters are analysed too, which shall be implemented in application later.

Glimpse of the application:
